# What am I using in my project?
 <br/>

### I am using reactjs with firebase in this project.
<br>

1. for **firebase**, I am using some functions.
<<<<<<< HEAD
   1. initializeApp: for initializing app with firebase.
   <br>
   1. getAuth: for creat Authentication like SignUp, SignIn, SignOut.
   <br>
   1. getFirestore: for holding your application database.
   <br>
   1. getStorage: this allows us to add some data or what we need to firebase.
   

Also, we import other methods like collection, onSnapshot to deal with data in firebase.

<br>

1. for **Reactjs** 
    1. we imported react-router-dom: for navigating between pages.
    <br>
    2. we used Aos library for Animations.
    <br>
    3. use Some hooks like useEffect, useState.
    <br>   
    4. use react-icons to add some icons for its pretty much easy to use.
    <br> 
    5. I have used react-bootstrap.
    <br>
    6. Also, I use for handle form Formik and Yup for Schema validation.
